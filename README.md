*   **[Challenges and advances for huntingtin detection in cerebrospinal fluid: in support of relative quantification.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259428/)** (PMID: 40259428)
    *   This study highlights challenges in accurately quantifying mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein in Huntington disease (HD) patients using current antibody-based assays, as factors like protein fragmentation, oligomerization, and polyglutamine length affect detection signals. The findings caution against reporting absolute mHTT concentrations and using the MW1 antibody for wildtype HTT quantification due to its lack of specificity and incomplete depletion. These insights are critical for pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences, as they emphasize the need for improved assay standardization in clinical trials evaluating HTT-lowering therapies, recommending relative quantitation and consistent sample preparation instead.

*   **[A real-world pharmacovigilance study of netarsudil based on the FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259426/)** (PMID: 40259426)
    *   This FAERS database analysis identified 63 adverse event (AE) signals associated with netarsudil, including 21 new ocular AEs (e.g., allergic blepharitis, corneal hemorrhage) and 4 unexpected systemic AEs (e.g., hypersensitivity), expanding its known safety profile. Most AEs occurred early (median onset: 1 day), with age-related differences in AE patterns, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring upon treatment initiation. The findings provide pharmacists and clinicians with critical real-world safety data to optimize risk assessment and patient counseling for this ophthalmic agent.

*   **[Transitional and CD21- PD-1+ B cells are associated with remission in early rheumatoid arthritis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259340/)** (PMID: 40259340)
    *   This study identified that higher proportions of transitional and CD21- PD-1+ B cells at diagnosis were associated with Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission at 24 weeks in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, suggesting these B-cell subsets could serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment response. The combination of these B-cell populations showed moderate sensitivity (59%) and high specificity (86%) for predicting remission across different treatment regimens, including methotrexate with prednisolone, anti-TNF, CTLA4-Ig, or anti-IL-6R. These findings highlight the potential role of B-cell profiling in personalizing RA therapy, which could enhance treatment selection and outcomes in pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences.

*   **[Impact of China's diagnosis-intervention packet payment reform on pediatric pneumonia hospitalization costs: an interrupted time series analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40259332/)** (PMID: 40259332)
    *   This study found that China's diagnosis-intervention packet (DIP) payment reform significantly reduced hospitalization costs for pediatric pneumonia (median cost decrease of ~300 RMB), primarily through lower medication and diagnostic service expenses, while improving cure rates (87.0% to 90.6%) without increasing ICU transfers. The results demonstrate that DIP reform can promote cost-effective, value-based care in pediatric pneumonia treatment, offering insights for healthcare systems aiming to balance cost containment with quality outcomes. These findings are relevant to pharmacy practice by highlighting how payment reforms can drive rational medication use and optimize resource allocation in pediatric care.
